XChart is a charting API for Java. While several charting APIs already
exist, most of them require a steep learning curve and the code base
is bloated, full of too many "features" and/or very outdated. 
Inspired by SWTCharts, simplicity is prioritized over everything else 
so you can quickly make a plot and move on. XCharts can be used in
your Swing, Java EE, and Java SE applications. If you're looking for
a Java charting API that is easy to use and does not need every feature
under the sun, XChart is for you.
